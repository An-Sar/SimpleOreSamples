This mod adds surface piles of the ores below. This is of course unnecessary on vanilla ore gen and is meant for pack with custom ore gen.

 

An ore sample is made by simply configuring the config file for the mod, its in the format "Ore:tintcolor:type" where Ore is the oredict name of the ore wihtout the "ore" infront (so to make a sample for iron ore its "Iron:11571064:ore", or certus quartz from AE2 is "CertusQuartz:16777215:gem").  This page allows you easily to find the int value of  colors : https://www.shodor.org/stella2java/rgbint.html

 

Be careful an make sure both the config on the client and the server contains the same entries otherwise things might go very bad.
